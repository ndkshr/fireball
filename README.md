"Fireball" is a game I made back in 2014 when I was just 16. I used Turbo C++ because it was the only thing available to me at the time, and I didn't have internet access for guidance. So, I had to rely on books and whatever help I could get from friends.

The game itself is pretty basic. It's inspired by old-school arcade games like DX Ball and Atari Breakout. Since I couldn't do fancy graphics, I used ASCII art to represent everything in the game - the ball, paddle, bricks, you name it.

Honestly, "Fireball" isn't anything groundbreaking. It's just a simple project I put together as a high schooler with limited resources. But hey, it was a fun learning experience, and it's kind of nostalgic to look back on now.
